# Optional ordered list of Rsync filter patterns following the rsync (1) FILTER
# RULES If nothing is specified then all files and directories are synchronized.

# Common rule format is:

#
# The following example will exclude any files in directories with name "build"
# except they are in directory "t/build" and also all ".gitignore" files and all
# files with extension ".pyc"
rsync_filter - .gitignore
filter - *.pyc

# monitored for changes.
