# Ordered list of Rsync filter patterns following the rsync (1) FILTER RULES
# If nothing is specified then all files and directories are
# synchronized.
# Common rule format is:
# [rsync_]filter <rule_prefix>[<modifier>] <pattern-or-filename>

# The following will exclude any files in directories with name "build" except
# they are in directory "t/build" and also all ".gitignore" files and all files
# with extension ".pyc"
